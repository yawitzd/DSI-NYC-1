### Overview

This will be an overview of your approach with a well-articulated summary that includes your problem statement, outlines your proposed methods and models, defines any risks & assumptions, and includes any revisions from your initial goals & criteria, as needed.

In addition, you'll want to create a local database for your data, import and clean your data. You'll want to describe and create a data dictionary for your dataset(s), and perform your initial exploratory data analysis.

**Goal**: A summary notebook outlining your project's goals, methods, models, and EDA.

### Requirements

Your work must:

- Articulate “Specific aim”
- Outline proposed methods and models
- Define risks & assumptions
- Revise initial goals & success criteria, as needed
- Create local database
- Describe data cleaning/munging techniques
- Create a data dictionary (describing the contents of each variable)
- Perform & summarize EDA

- ***Bonus:***
 - Explain how you intend to evaluate your results. What tuning metric and evaluation approaches do you intend to use?
 - Identify 1-2 additional datasets that may help you triangulate your findings. How might these relate to your data?
 - Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) that describes your assumptions and processes for EDA. Link to it in your Jupyter notebook.

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

 - Materials must be submitted in a clearly labeled Jupyter notebook, including:
  - Markdown writeups, code, and visualizations
 - Materials must be submitted to Github by the end of Week 9.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success!
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Document **everything**.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

[Attached here is a complete rubric for this project.](./part-02-rubric.md)

Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
