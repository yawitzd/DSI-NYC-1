The time is arranged in a weird fashion as it is impossible to know if the time is actually telling the time or if it's the actual length of the song. The fact that AM is added makes it more confusing. The genres are also mislabeled or not as labeling a genre a certain way is up to the person and maybe the billboards have their own way of classifying songs and also the genres were (I think) according to the song and not to the type of singer the artist is.
