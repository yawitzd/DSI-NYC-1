You can have 30 - 0, 29 - 1, 28 - 2, etc. (basically the Gaussian trick of counting). If we were to visualize it, this could be solved by imposing the formula $\\binom{30 + 1}{1}=1$, which satisfies our intuition. However, we want to ensure that each person gets at least one ball, so what do we do? Simple, subtract 30-10 = 20, since we are holding at least 1 ball for each individual, therefore the new counting is just $\\binom{20+1}{1}$. \n",
