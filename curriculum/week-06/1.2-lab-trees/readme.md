## Introduction

In this lab, we will discover how to apply decision trees to regression and classification problems. In particular, we will use regression trees to predict the price of used cars and classification trees to predict the acceptability of those cars.

## Exercise

### Requirements

1. Let's build a regression tree
- Build a regression tree in scikit-learn
    - Global parameters
    - Feature importances
    - Tree visualization
    - Use GridSearchCV to find the best Regression Tree
- Classification trees
    - Building a classification tree in scikit-learn

**Bonus:**

- Visualize a more complex tree and interpret it
